# Poolpals Lottery
Poolpals is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables users to save money in a no-loss lottery. The platform uses blockchain technology to create a savings account that provides users with a chance to win a prize pool without risking their deposited funds. Users deposit their money into a prize pool, and the interest generated from the deposits is used to create a prize for one lucky winner.

Poolpals aims to make saving money fun and rewarding, while also providing a safe and secure platform for users to save their money.
